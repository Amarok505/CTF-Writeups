# Oh Christmas Tree

Search for strings in the file and grep the flag by running

```c
strings Merry\ Christmas.jpg | grep X-MAS{
```
First I got distracted by the last flag and failed submitting it. Then I tried to complete the rest of the flag by logic. So, I opened it with vim and the remeaning two parts after a few moments.

Flag: `X-MAS{0_Chr15tmas_tr33_1s_th1s_a_flag_i_wond3r}`
