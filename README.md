## What is this?

It's all about **solving complex computer challanges relating to Security** in computers. Players are supposed to make their way through  **web applications, network and binary analysis, forensics, reverse engeneering, exploit, cryptography** and whatever 10 times more crazy than what you can imagine to get the flag  that will prove that the player(s) have succesfully solved a challange. That's what CTF stands for: **C**apture **T**he **F**lag. 

There are **two main types of CTFs: Attack-Defense and Jeopardy.**

In Attack-Defense each team is given a network or server which they have to protect and at the same time try to get into the other's teams system... but, that's for professional players that can afford to travel to a competition.

**Here I write about Jeopardy style CTF.** They're fun too. Players are given a set of isolated challanges and they are supposed to solve them before the time ends, usually a few days. Each Challange has more points depending on its difficulty and at the end of the competition they are summed to get the best players or teams. In some ocassions, rewards might be given to winners of the contests Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯. After the contest, **Writeups** are created by players that solved the challanges to show the steps they followed and some might also show their thinking progress.

If you are intersted in this and would like to try at you own I recommend CTF-Time. There CTF organizers schedule a contest so that it's is easy for players to find it. For more information I recommend watching [LiveOverflow's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ev9ZX9J45A) about CTFs. Overall, it's a good YouTube channel to learn about hacking and CTFs. I'm currently practicing his binary and web series.
